If t-value is large => the two groups belong to different groups. 

If t-value is small => the two groups belong to same group.

t-tests are widely used in the fields of research in hospitals by experts to gain important information about the medical data given to them about effects of various medicines and drugs on the population and helps them draw out important inferences regarding the same.
