# Quick Queue: Deque
# A deque is like a line where people can join or leave from both ends. This is handy when we need to manage information like a queue â€“ first in, first out!


from collections import deque

# Creating a Deque
people_line = deque(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'])

# Joining and Leaving
people_line.append('David') #right
print(people_line)

people_line.popleft() #left
print(people_line)

people_line.pop() #right
print(people_line)

people_line.appendleft('Elon') #left
print(people_line)
