Creating Sub Directories in Bulk:

n = 'GFG'
os.mkdir(n)
for i in range(1000):
    name = n +'/'+ n + " " + str(i+1) //i=0 GFG/GFG1 
                                     // i=50 GFG/GFG50
    os.mkdir(name)
 

This code can be used to create 1000 sub folders inside a folder GFG.

 

Hierarchal Bulk Directory Creation:

master = 'GFG'
os.mkdir(master)
n = 5
m = 5
for i in range(n):
    name = master +'/'+ master + " " + str(i+1)
    os.mkdir(name) 
    for j in range(m):
        name = master +'/'+ master + " " + str(i+1) +"/"+ master + " " + str(j+1) 
        os.mkdir(name)        
print(n*m + n + 1)
How this code will create directories 
GFG                            
    ->GFG 1
        ->GFG 1
        ->GFG 2
        ->GFG 3
        ->GFG 4
        ->GFG 5
    ->GFG 2
        ->GFG 1
        ->GFG 2
        ->GFG 3
        ->GFG 4
        ->GFG 5
    ->GFG 3
        ->GFG 1
        ->GFG 2
        ->GFG 3
        ->GFG 4
        ->GFG 5
    ->GFG 4
        ->GFG 1
        ->GFG 2
        ->GFG 3
        ->GFG 4
        ->GFG 5
    ->GFG 5
        ->GFG 1
        ->GFG 2
        ->GFG 3
        ->GFG 4
        ->GFG 5
The outer loop n will be used to create main 5 folders GFG 1 GFG 2 so on up-to GFG 5 then the inner m loop will be used to create 5 sub directories.

Hence Each directory will be having 5 sub directories

Master directory i.e., GFG = 1

Child directories = 5 {GFG1 GFG2 â€¦ GFG5}

Number of inner directories = 25

Hence 31 directories will be created for this code changing values of m and n will change the number of directories created.
