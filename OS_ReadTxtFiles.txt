Reading Text files in bulk

for i in files:
    if i != '.DS_Store':
        fd = open('Files/'+i,'r')
        print('Files/'+i, fd.read())
        fd.close()
 

We will open the first file i.e., Files/1 in read mode then print it using fd.read() and close the file.

This will be done for all files hence bulk file reading
