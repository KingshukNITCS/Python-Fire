'''
Character to ASCII Code
You can use the ord function to get the ASCII code of a character.
'''
char = 'A'
ascii_code = ord(char)
print(f"The ASCII code of '{char}' is {ascii_code}")
# Output - The ASCII code of 'A' is 65


'''
ASCII Code to Character
Conversely, the chr
 function converts an ASCII code to its corresponding character.
 '''
ascii_code = 97
character = chr(ascii_code)
print(f"The character with ASCII code {ascii_code} is '{character}'")
# Output - The character with ASCII code 97 is 'a'
